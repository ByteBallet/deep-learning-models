## Deep Learning Models

This repository contains scripts to train deep learning models optimized to run well on AWS. Apart from scripts to build and train the model, we also share here scripts to setup a high performing cluster for deep learning using AWS, and preprocessing scripts to prepare datasets.

Currently, it has scripts for training Resnet50 with Imagenet using Apache MXNet and Tensorflow.
Feel free to create a Github issue here if you have any questions.
